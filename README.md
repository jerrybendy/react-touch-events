# react-touch-events  [![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-touch-events.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-touch-events)
Enable tap / swipe events for react

> This document is for v2.x.  
> v3 has no document yet.

## Install

Use `npm`

```shell
npm i -S react-touch-events
```

We have removed all click events from `ReactTouchEvents` since v2.x. If you want use click event fallback, please use the v1.x version with `npm i -S react-touch-events@1`.


## Usage

```js
import ReactTouchEvents from "react-touch-events";
```

You can also use as UMD mode. Download the library file from `lib/index.js`(there provide uncompress file only) and add a `script` tag like this and you can use `window.ReactTouchEvents` now:

```html
<script src="path/to/lib/index.js"></script>
```


In React

```js
<ReactTouchEvents 
    onTap={ this.handleTap }
    onSwipe={ this.handleSwipe }
    >
```


The full example:

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactTouchEvents from "react-touch-events";

class Test extends React.Components {

    handleTap () {
    
        console.log("you have taped me");
    
    }
    
    handleSwipe (direction) {
    
        switch (direction) {
            case "top":
            case "bottom":
            case "left":
            case "right":
            
                console.log(`you swiped ${direction}`)
        
        }
    }



    render () {
        <ReactTouchEvents
            onTap={ this.handleTap.bind(this) }
            onSwipe={ this.handleSwipe.bind(this) }
            >
            
            <button>Tap me</button>
